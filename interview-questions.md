# ASSESSMENT 4: Interview Practice Questions

Answer the following questions.

First, without external resources. Challenge yourself to answer from memory.

Then, research the question to expand on your answer. Even if you feel you have answered the question completely on your own, there is always something more to learn. Write your researched answer in your OWN WORDS.

1. What is object-oriented programming? How is it different than functional programming?

Your answer:
OOP is programming based on everything is an instance of a class holding specific data. Functional programmimg relies on the use of creating and using functions for computations

Researched answer:
OOP is a programming standard that was created to deal with complex and large software systems. Objects can contain data and behavior and offers better modularity and can be based on real world objects.

Functional Programming treats programming as mathematical approach through evaluation of functions and their interactions. Functional programming keeps data and behavior separate unlike OOP.

2. What is the difference between a Float and an Integer in Ruby?

Your answer:
A float is a number (decimal) that can extend as long as a computer architecture permits. An integer is without a decimal where if an evaluation equals a decimal, the decimal is truncated.

Researched answer:
Float and Integer are classes in Ruby and are used to represent numbers. They differ in their precision where an integer is a fixed number without decimal. A float is a floating-point number and its precision is approximated.

3. Ruby has an implicit return. What does that mean?

Your answer:
A line of code where a return keyword is not needed and is implied

Researched answer:
Implicit return is Ruby's language behavior that automatically return the last line in a method without a return keyword

4. What is a block in Ruby?

Your answer:
A block is a chunk of code in a method

Researched answer:
A ruby block is an anonymous function that is passed to a method to determin the outcome. Blcoks are typically defined with do and end or {}

5. How do you extract a single value from a Ruby hash?

Your answer:
By referencing its key such as
hash = {name: 'bao'}
hash[:name] #==> output is "bao"

Researched answer:
Extracting a single value can be accessed as mentioned above
